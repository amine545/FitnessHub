</li>

  <li> Ground toes into the floor and squeeze glutes to stabilize your body. Your legs should be working too.</li>
  
  <li> Neutralize your neck and spine by looking at a spot on the floor about a foot beyond your hands. Your head should be in line with your back.</li>
  
 <li> Lower your body until right thigh is parallel to the floor and right shin is vertical. It’s OK if knee shifts forward a little as long as it doesn’t go past right toe.</li> 
  
 <li> Hold the position for 20 seconds. As you get more comfortable with the move, hold your plank for as long as possible without compromising your form or breath.</li>
